          <h2>National Financial Inclusion Strategy (2018-2020)</h2>
          <h3>
            In recent years, inclusive growth and development have gained traction as a development policy paradigm in
            developing
            and emerging countries. Parallel to this development has been the wider and increasing recognition of the
            pivotal role
            of inclusive finance in development and the need to address head-on the high level of financial exclusion in
            these
            countries to harness the potential of finance for inclusive growth and development.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The G20 made financial inclusion as one of its main development pillars at the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009.
            The World Bank
            launched the initiative for Universal Access to Finance by 2020. Upon adopting the Sustainable Development
            Goals (SDGs)
            in September 2015, the UN General Assembly reinforced the critical role of financial inclusion for the 2030
            Agenda for
            Sustainable Development in December 2015. There is a consensus among policymakers, practitioners as well as
            academics
            that financial inclusion is a pre-requisite, a key enabler for the achievement of most of the SDGs. In turn,
            inclusive
            finance is referenced in seven of the 17 SDGs. What is remarkable of the developments in the field of
            finance is that
            most national-level policymakers including the central banks or other financial sector regulatory bodies
            have shown an
            increased willingness to assign top priority to financial inclusion even though financial inclusion has
            historically not
            been within their core remit. The Arab world has witnessed an increased momentum in policy dialogue and
            national
            initiatives to address financial inclusion. The Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) stated at the
            launching
            event for the Financial Inclusion Vision for Jordan in September 2016 that "it is a right for everyone to
            have access to
            financial services. in addition to that, in most developing and emerging countries, the policymakers have
            made concerted
            efforts to advance financial inclusion systematically without compromising the financial stability goal of
            financial
            sector regulators. It is widely accepted that under a robust regulatory and supervisory framework, financial
            inclusion
            can even substantially strengthen financial stability. Within these broader developments, National Financial
            Inclusion
            Strategies (NFIS) have become a widely used tool for accelerating financial inclusion in most countries.
            Empirical
            evidence by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) has shown that NFISs are an effective tool: countries
            with NFISs
            have done relatively better in promoting and advancing financial inclusion than those without. It is in this
            broader
            global context that the CBJ has been pursuing financial inclusion since 2012 and guided in 2015 the
            formulation of the
            National Strategy for Financial Inclusion in Jordan. The CBJ embarked on a national, multi-stakeholder
            policy process
            for enhancing the formal financial inclusion of the entire population, mainly among the youth, women,
            refugees,
            low-income segments and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. With the NFIS for Jordan 2018-2020, the
            CBJ and its
            partners cater to enhance financial inclusion of people and businesses in the Kingdom based on evidence and
            deliberately
            and prudently in view of impacting sustainable economic and social development aligned with the UN SDGs. It
            is therefore
            guided by the 2017 Financial Inclusion Diagnostic mandated by the CBJ and commissioned by GIZ.

          <p>The formal financial sector in Jordan has expanded substantially and contributed significantly to the
            economic growth of
            Jordan over the last decades, while the number and size of banks and non-bank financial institutions alike
            have
            increased. Growth in the formal financial sector, however, has benefited only a small portion of the
            population. Only
            33% of adults in Jordan, 27% of women, are financially included in terms of account ownership. The rate,
            though the
            highest among peers in the MENA region, is considered low when compared to other countries with the same
            income levels.
            The majority of the people living in Jordan has been excluded from the formal financial system and denied
            effective
            economic participation, thereby operating in the informal economy and relying increasingly on informal
            financial
            services. Access to and usage of formal financial services needs to be addressed systematically for the
            reasons of
            inclusive growth and development. NFIS facilitate advancements in the access to, the usage and quality of
            financial
            services, which in return positively affects inclusive growth and shared prosperity. The rationale for the
            development
            and implementation of the NFIS for Jordan stems from several inter-linked key factors:</p>

          <div class="points">
            <h4>High level of financial exclusion</h4>
            <p>67% of people in Jordan above the age of 15 years do not have access to the formal financial system in
              terms of account
              ownership; 38.0% of adults are excluded from any formal financial services and 24.8% of adults are
              completely excluded
              from any formal and informal financial services. The majority of MSMEs are financially constrained.
              Evidence suggests
              that carefully designed NFISs may address high levels of financial exclusion. More than 32 AFI member
              institution
              countries currently have an effective NFIS, while more than 25 member institution countries are at
              stages of formulating
              a NFIS.

          <h3>The NFIS for Jordan will allow for a coordinated, collaborative and cooperative multi-stakeholder approach
            to financial
            inclusion and generate shared ownership by national stakeholders, all of which is essential to efficiently
            and
            effectively achieve an impact on sustainable development. The NFIS provides new opportunities for
            public-private
            partnerships within an operational framework, thus guiding resources towards priority policy areas and key
            target groups
            of financial inclusion in Jordan.
