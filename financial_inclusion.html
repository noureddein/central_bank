        <p class="title">What is Financial Inclusion?</p>
        <p class="sub-title">Financial inclusion is the state wherein individuals and businesses have convenient access
          to
          and use
          affordable and
          suitable financial products and services – payments, savings, credit, transactions and insurance– that meet
          their needs,</p>

        <div class="description">
          <p>help to improve their lives, and delivered responsible and sustainable way. Being able to access a
            transactional account
            is the first step towards broader financial inclusion since the transactional account allows individuals and
            businesses
            to store money and send and receive payments.</p>
          <p>
            Financial access facilitates everyday life and helps individuals and companies plan everything from
            long-term
            goals to
            unforeseen contingencies. As accountholders, individuals and companies are more likely to use other
            financial
            services,
            like credit and insurance, and have more opportunities to benefit from financial sources, and to start and
            expand
            businesses, invest in education or health, manage economic risks and shocks that can improve the overall
            quality
            if
            their lives.</p>
