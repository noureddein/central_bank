        <p class="title">Financial Inclusion Policies and Strategies in Jordan</p>
        <p class="sub-title">Jordan's Vision for Financial Inclusion</p>
        <p class="item">The Government of Jordan recognizes financial inclusion as an important pillar in inclusive
          growth and
          sustainable
          development. It embarked on the national financial inclusion policy process to build an enabling legal and
          regulatory
          framework and infrastructure to achieve a more inclusive financial system.</p>
        <img src="./assets/jordan_vision/jordan_vision2.png" alt="">
        <p class="item">The CBJ understands financial inclusion not as an end in itself, but as a means to an end.
          Access to and
          usage of
          financial products and services at the macro level strengthens inclusive growth, stimulates employment,
          reduces poverty
          and inequality, and contributes to the stability and integrity of the financial system. At individual and
          business
          level, financial inclusion enhances social well-being: payments and money transfer services facilitate
          day-to-day lives,
          loans enable to invest in new ventures, accounts allow to save for the future, insurance increases resilience
          against
          shocks.</p>
        <p class="item">Financial inclusion policies and actions in Jordan are thus geared towards empowering the
          financially
          excluded and
          underserved – the majority of the population, particularly the vulnerable groups of young adults, women,
          refugees,
          low-income segments, and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Financial inclusion needs to
          enable the
          majority of the population and enterprises to move from the informal to the formal economy; to enable them to
          harness
          their potential of contributing more actively to local economic and social developments and benefit from them.
          Success
          in this regard needs to be measured in terms of impact – the extent to which the financially excluded and
          underserved
          segments are able to improve their standard of living.</p>
        <p class="item">
          The NFIS for Jordan will strengthen the link between financial inclusion and sustainable economic and social
          development
          in alignment with SDGs. It will balance the four policy objectives of financial inclusion, the stability of
          the
          financial system following the Central Bank Law (23/1971), financial integrity following the AML / CFT regime
          and
          National Risk Assessments,13 and protection of financial consumers following laws and regulations for treating
          clients
          fairly (I-SIP). The CBJ leads and oversees the participatory, consultative multi-stakeholder policy process
          for
          executing the NFIS for Jordan firstly over three years from 2018 to 2020, following the G20 Principles on
          Innovative
          Financial Inclusion. Assuring inter-agency coordination and cooperation, it engages all relevant public,
          private and
          civil society stakeholders, which act within a clear framework and under an effective governance structure.
